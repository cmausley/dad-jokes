This is **Project 10** of Udemy's ["50 Projects in 50 Days for HTML, CSS and JavaScript"](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23595208#overview) taught by Brad Traversy.

In this application, we flip through a set of jokes using a third-party API. The application uses FETCH APIs to take a joke, and inject it into the application.
